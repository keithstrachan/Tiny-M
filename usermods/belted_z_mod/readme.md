### Belted Z Mod for 150mm and 190mm Tiny-M

![Back](https://github.com/gsl12/Tiny-M/blob/master/usermods/belted_z_mod/Images/CAD%20back.png)

Modified from V0 belted z mod for Tiny-M printer, 2020 extrusions, and to upgrade some bolts from M3 to M5.

CAD shows a printed 80T gear because I copied that over from the V0 belted z files, but I used a metal 80T gear.

The M5x20mm screws need to be BHCS for clearance with 80T gear, but all other bolts can be either SHCS or BHCS.

Print the Bottom Frame Bracket 190.stl version if using this on a 190mm^3 Tiny-M
