### Shoulder Screw Mod

by Ocho Camino

This is a mod to use shoulder screws instead of regular metric screws as the shafts for the idlers to ride upon.  

#### Rationale

Shoulder screws are machined to specified dimensions vs screws which are undersized and often have a rough surface.  With undersized screws the contact area of the screw to the inner race of the bearing is much less (ideally a line), creating excessive Hertzian contact stress.  This is hard on the bearing and can create imprecision in the motion of the machine.

#### Description

This mod either uses Misumi 5mm shoulder screws which have M3 threads on the end, or McMaster or other shoulder screws which have M4 threads.  The thread lengths are important on the McMaster M4 version, so if substituting other sources you may need to remove some thread if it's too long and bottoms out.

On the four corners of Tiny-M the ends of the 2020s are tapped M5 for M5 screws.  If using Misumi shoulders, you will need thread adapters.   If using M4 shoulders you will need M4 Helicoils

Total cost of this mod is about $25-$30.
