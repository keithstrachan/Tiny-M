### Tiny-dooM

- @Ocho Camino


An outer enclosure around the Tiny-M printer.  This has only been designed in CAD.  Nothing has been done IRL.

#### BOM

Nothing is changed from the default Tiny-M BOM.  However you will need to drill 2 blind joint access holes in the 4 z corner extrusions.  Those holes should be approx 30mm from the ends and face fore and aft.  They are used to attach the Tiny-M to the dooM frame.

For a 190^3 Tiny-dooM add 50mm to every extrusion length

- 4x HFSR5-404020-500 Corner Posts
- Non-smooth faced extrusion option
  - 8x HFS5-2020-260 Top and bottom horizontals
  - 2x HFS5-2020-217 Front door horizontals
  - 2x HFS5-2020-408 Front door verticals
- Smooth faced extrusion option
  - 2x HFS5-2020-260 Top and bottom rear horizontals (Slots exposed for mounting things)
  - 3x HFSF5-2020-260 - Bottom front, left and right horizontals
  - 3x HFST5-2020-260 - Top front, left and right horizontals
  - 2x HFSF5-2020-217 Front door horizontals
  - 2x HFSF5-2020-408 Front door verticals - you will need to drill holes for hinges and handle
