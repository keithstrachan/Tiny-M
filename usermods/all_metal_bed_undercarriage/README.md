## Rationale
The existing bed mounts are made of ABS and flex somewhat.   Making the entire bed undercarriage out of metal greatly reduces this flex.

## Status

  Alpha.  Still testing.  There could be some changes.
  
## BOM

150mm Bed:
- 1x HFSB5-2040-160-LTP-AH10-BH150-AV80-Z5-XA28.5-XB48.5-XC111.5-XD131.5 (Misumi).   You may drill the holes yourself and save $.  Drill jigs coming soon.
- 1x HFSB5-2020-133-RTP-AH10 (Misumi). 

190mm Bed:
- 1x HFSB5-2040-200-LTP-AH10-BH190-AV100-Z5-XA28.5-XB48.5-XC151.5-XD171.5
- 1x HFSB5-2020-173-RTP-AH10

Common:
- 6x Openbuilds Angle Brackets [Openbuilds](https://openbuildspartstore.com/black-angle-corner-connector/) [Ali Express](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32899575950.html)
- 3x 16mm long silicone bed mounts [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07RZKF8MB?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details)
- 3x Bed Adjusters (reuse existing) [Ali Experss Style B or D](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000421280308.html)
- 3x 45mm (or 50mm) FHCS screws.  45s protrude only 2.3 mm below the extrusion, so 50 is probably better.
- 4x M3 washers (at least 6mm OD)
- 4x M3x8 SHCS
- 9x M5x6 BHCS
- 1x M5x12 SHCS
- 1x M5x16 SHCS

## Assembly

Note the rear two holes on the bed are in slightly different positions than on stock Tiny-M.   Use the template (TBD) to drill the two countersunk M3 holes.   

The two angle brackets that support the forward spar can be any type of angle bracket.  Make sure this connection is solid and doesn't twist or flex.   The other angle brackets must be 20x20 triangles with no protrusions.  Cubes will snag on the printhead.  

Print the parts (ok, it's not all metal, but the load bearing parts are).  The nosepiece can be printed with a filament swap for a contrasting color for the logo.   Assembly of the rest of the parts should be straightforward.   The Openbuilds corner brackts screw into the top screw holes of the MGN12H cars.  The lower screw holes are not used.
