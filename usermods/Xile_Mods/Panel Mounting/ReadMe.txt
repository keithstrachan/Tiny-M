The Panel_Holder is used to support paneles from the backside. Sometimes the panels will tend to move and bend with heat from the chamber, these are used to support and avoid this causing an issue!

PanelClip is a remix of Anlins 2020 panel clips over at Annex! Difference being that these clips use screws versus the quick clips that the originals use!
