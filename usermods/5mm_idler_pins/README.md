### 5mm Dowel Pin Mod
- Ocho Camino

NOTE:  The 5mm shoulder screw mod is recommended over this mod.

This is a mod to use 5mm dowel pins instead of fasteners for the idlers to ride on.  It is based on the V4 gantry.

#### RATIONALE
Dowel pins are exactly 5mm in diameter vs the typical 4.8mm of M5 screws.  This provides a better bearing surface for the inner race of the idler bearings.  Bearing on threads is especially problematic.
It should prolong the life of the bearings and improve print quality because there's signicantly less play.

This mod has not been tested yet!  I am slightly concerned about the rigidity of the front idler mounts as they aren't connected to the corner posts anymore.   

#### BOM
  - 10x 5mmx32mm dowel pins.  [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/91585A569/).  30mm pins may be substituted.  You may also cut down 5mm drill rod or other precision stock to length.  Note some holes can accomodate longer than 32mm pins, so measure and make them longer if need be.

#### INSTALLATION OF PINS
You will probably need to drill out the holes in the parts with a 5mm drill bit.  The idler bearings and toothed idler should slide along the length of the pin.  If the pin is oversized (most dowel pins are), chuck it up in a drill and use 400 grit sandpaper to reduce the diameter.  You shouldn't need to remove more than 0.01mm so check as you go.   

Press the pins into the parts while capturing the bearings/washers/idlers.  If you overcompress the part and bind the bearings, you may need to gently pry the assembly apart a tiny bit.  If the pin is loose, place some thin CA adhesive in the pin holes top and bottom.
